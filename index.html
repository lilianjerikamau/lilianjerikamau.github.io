          <h2>Hello üëãüèø</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Lilian, known as "Sherry." I'm an Android developer with expertise in Flutter, Kotlin, React
            Native, and Swift. My focus is on mobile development, creating applications that seamlessly work across
            various platforms and browsers. I have a strong commitment to building interfaces that are user-friendly and
            enjoyable for a wide range of users. Throughout my professional journey, I have been dedicated to utilizing
            technology to solve real-world problems, driven by my passion for making a positive impact through
            innovative solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although my academic background is rooted in business information technology, it wasn't until I engaged in
            an internship at a software company that I discovered my true passion for programming. Being an integral
            part of a web development team during that time allowed me to collaborate on diverse projects and truly
            appreciate the intricacies of software development.

            During my initial experiences, I acquired a strong foundation in essential technologies such as HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and PHP Laravel framework. As my enthusiasm for programming grew, I made the decision to further
            enhance my skills by enrolling in a rigorous 8-month bootcamp program at Moringa School. Currently, I am
            fully immersed in the realm of mobile application development, expanding my knowledge and capabilities in
            various mobile development technologies.

            This transition from business information technology to web development has been nothing short of
            transformative, igniting within me a profound passion and an unwavering drive to excel in the field of
            mobile application development. I am eagerly embracing opportunities to broaden my skill set and tackle new
            challenges in the ever-evolving world of technology.
          <p>
            In addition, I am a strong advocate for mental health and empowering women in the tech industry. I recognize
            that many women, including myself at one point, may hesitate to pursue tech and development due to the
            field's male-dominated nature. As a result, I aspire to mentor and guide young women, serving as a positive
            example that women are more than capable of excelling in this field. It is my aim to inspire and encourage
            these girls, fostering an environment of inclusivity and empowering them to embrace their potential.
